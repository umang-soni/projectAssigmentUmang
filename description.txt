I had implemented this assigment using React .
I had made Display  component in  component  folder where the whole code implemented 
IT   is responsive application
It  contain an input file acceptance  which accept excel  file  as my laptop  is not able to generate excel file so I used dummy file which contain same attribute
Then I use state mmanagement system  where I update the state   with uploaded file  of excel file .
and is re render if state is update .
I parse the data using papaparse 
It is working  with my dummy excel file .
I included pagination  with  th logic...
  const indexOfLastItem = currentPage * itemsPerPage;
  const indexOfFirstItem = indexOfLastItem - itemsPerPage;
  const currentItems = csvData.slice(indexOfFirstItem, indexOfLastItem);
  so we updtate the curent page variable using state management system  and get new bunch of data
  I applied tailwind css
  I applied font icon in  this project for design purpose
